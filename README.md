# FizzBuzz_JS

Solved FizzBuzz in JS using a TDD approach with Jasmine. 

To run the script and tests: 
- clone the repository and cd into it 
- npm t will run the tests

You'll need to have Node installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you've downloaded and installed it, npm will also be available. 

To install Jasmine: $ npm install jasmine --save-dev
